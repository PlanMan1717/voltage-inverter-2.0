This design for a voltage inverter was simulated on CircuitJS. (File included)
It has never been built physically, and has thus not been tested.

All gerbers, SVGs, board layout files, PDFs, and drill files are MOCKUPS.

I am not responsible for any injury that may arise using the board as-is.
Some board manufacturers may be unable to build this for various reasons.
Capacitors and diodes are not neccessarily rated for use here.

The board does not have a fuse built in. During simulation, low output impedance (roughly 39Î©) caused power consumption of more than 3 watts!
